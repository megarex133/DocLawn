            <p class="about__text">
              The idea to create a device for picking up dog poop was suggested
              to me by my friend. He has experience of owning several dogs and
              of course he walks them every day. Spending time with favorite
              pets is interrupted every time when they leave waste. To remove
              waste from the lawn, my friend must bend down, and with a plastic
              bag put on his hand, has to make contact with this unpleasant
              smelling sticky and slippery "substance". He assures me that even
              with careful use of the sealed bag, the smell of waste was still
              transmitted to his hands. In addition, he is worried about the
              ecology, pollution of the environment with disposable plastic
              bags. He asked to come up with a convenient device to solve this
              double "delicate" problem. And finally, I am pleased to present to
              your attention the DOCLawn device for picking up dog waste
            </p>

              <h3 class="card__title">DOCLawn – dog operation “clean lawn”</h3>
              <p class="card__text">
                The principle of its operation is very simple, and the whole
                procedure takes about 40 seconds. Just two clicks on the button
                and no more bending down to pick up waste. A replaceable
                cardboard cartridge is inserted into the DOCLawn by lightly
                pressing the hand or simply by pressing the DOCLawn on the
                cartridge located on the surface of the lawn. All you need to do
                is to lower the DOCLawn with the cartridge directly on the waste
                and press the button once. The cartridge will begin to rotate,
                and due to the low special shape the waste will begin to move
                from the surface of the lawn directly into the cartridge. To
                improve the efficiency of waste collecting it is necessary to
                raise and lower alternately the working DOCLawn on the dog
                waste. The rotation of the cartridge is stopped by pressing the
                button again. After collecting the waste, you can continue your
                walk while holding DOCLawn in your hand.
                  When approaching the waste collection point, you must press the
                  button twice, a special internal mechanism will stop holding the
                  cartridge, and it will fall into the trash can by itself. The
                  waste is removed, and the hands of the person and the cleaning
                  device itself remain clean.

                The double “delicate” problem has been resolved
              </h3>
              <p class="card__text">
                The removable cartridge is 100% regular cardboard, i.e. made of
                densely pressed layers of paper and PVA glue, the glue that is
                environmentally friendly and harmless so that even children in
                schools can use it safely. These cartridges are biodegradable
                with waste and can be recycled to reduce the amount of plastic
                used by humans and improve the environment.

              </h3>
              <p class="card__text">
                As a bonus, DOCLawn has an awesome flashlight for cleaning up
                waste in the dark or for a safe walk. Due to its location on the
                device, the flashlight illuminates the cleaning area very well.
                The power of the flashlight is enough to illuminate a large
                area. Switching on/ switching off occurs by long pressing of the
                button.

                  The honesty and openness of the creator, the transparency of
                  the project is the basis of the crowdfunding platform, all
                  these things make people trust in the project. We do
                  understand that unforeseen problems and difficulties may arise
                  at any stage of the practical implementation of the project.
                  However, confidence in the success of our project is based on
                  the results of a detailed calculation of the feasibility study
                  and a lot of preparatory work before the start of DOCLawn
                  production, that led to the project's release to fundraising.
                  The materials provided do not include computer graphics or
                  modeling. All videos are real and unprocessed. It is important
                  for us to provide real DOCLawn work without embellishments.
                  Therefore, in tests and final videos, we have always tested it
                  not on bananas or other substitutes, but on the dog feces
                  itself. In addition, in order to protect intellectual
                  property, documents for patent and trademark registration of

                  The product is ready for serial production. The DOCLawn
                  creator has done a lot of work from the idea to the existing
                  sample. Many tests have been carried out. All electrical
                  components used, except the printed circuit board (PCB), are
                  widespread and available for order from factories around the
                  world. The PCB is custom designed and produced specifically
                  for DOCLawn. Design documentation has been prepared. All of
                  DOCLawn's composite plastic parts are now 3D printed, and have
                  been checked by technical expertise for manufacturing
                  injection molded plastic in production. In addition, we did
                  not waste time and have already designed the molds with
                  engineering documentation and drawings. Negotiations were
                  carried on with all factories, where orders for the production
                  of the necessary parts will be placed. We clearly understand
                  when, how, where and what else will need to be done to tie all
                  these links of one production chain together.

                  We expect to start shipping the first units of DOCLawn to
                  backers approximately 120-140 days after the end of the
                  campaign. This parameter consists of the following components:
                  The order and delivery of the necessary electronic components
                  for assembly; the manufacture of molds for plastic injection
                  at metalworking factories will take about 90 days. The rest of
                  the time will be spent on assembling and preparing DOCLawn for
                  sending to backers. However, increased demand may change the
                  delivery time and schedule. For example, one DOCLawn bill of
                  materials (BOM) includes 41 items of various parts. In order
                  to reduce the time it takes for backers to receive DocLawn, we
                  will start to organize the production and manufacture
                  components as soon as the preliminary order quantity is known,
                  without waiting for the end of the project. The production of
                  replacement cardboard cartridges will begin immediately after
                  the end of the campaign and will take place concurrently with
                  the production of the main unit.

                  The principle of operation is very simple, the whole procedure for collecting dog poop takes about 40 seconds and requires only two presses of the button. A replaceable cardboard cartridge is inserted into DOCLawn in advance. This is done by lightly inserting it into the device or simply pressing DOCLawn on the cartridge installed on the surface. After installing the cartridge, you need to lower the DOCLawn directly on the dog waste and press the button once. The cartridge will begin to rotate and dog waste will begin to move from the surface of the lawn directly into the cartridge due to its special shape. To improve the collecting efficiency of the item it is necessary to alternately raise and lower the working DOCLawn on the waste. The rotation of the cartridge is stopped by pressing the button again. After collecting waste, you can continue your walk while holding DOCLawn in your hands. When approaching the waste collection point, you must press the button twice, a special internal mechanism will stop holding the cartridge, and it will fall into the trash can. Dog waste is removed, and the hands of the person and the cleaning device itself remain clean.

After receiving DOCLawn, you will need to install two 18650 batteries, each with a capacity of at least 2200 mA. Batteries are not included in the package. This decision was made in order to avoid unnecessary problems with the postal delivery of DOCLawn, since different transport companies have their own safety standards and special restrictions apply to the shipment of batteries.

                  This parameter depends on the duration of the flashlight use and the rotation time of the DOCLawn motors. Tests have shown that when using the device in normal mode twice a day, recharging will be required once every 3-4 weeks. The batteries are recharged via a conventional telephone charger (110-220V) of the USB Type-C standard (not included in the delivery set). To recharge, you will need to remove the cover or telescopic handle.
The battery charge status signaling is realized by means of the control button illumination as follows:
short blinking - it is necessary to recharge the battery;
long blinking - the charging is in progress;
constant lit and extinguished backlight - the battery is charged.

                  The standard set includes DOCLawn itself, a replaceable telescopic handle and 56 cartridges. In addition, depending on the order, you can also order extra box of replacement cartridges.
                  Batteries and a charger are not included in the package.

                <p class="faq__paragraph">
                  DOCLawn can be used in all seasons. With prolonged exposure to cold, a slight decrease in the capacity of the batteries is possible, which will entail more frequent recharging.

                    How bright does the flashlight shine?
                  </h3>
                </div>
                <p class="faq__paragraph">
                  Due to its position on the lower circumference of the DOCLawn, the flashlight illuminates the cleaning area very well. There is enough lighting to illuminate a large area. The electronic circuit is designed so that the luminescence intensity does not depend on the state of charge of the batteries. The flashlight will always shine the same. Switching on / switching off occurs by long pressing of the button.

                <p class="faq__paragraph">
                  Small part of DOCLawn's electronic components will be ordered in Asia, most of the parts themselves and the final assembly will be made in Belarus. In the future, the production of replacement cartridges will be localized in local markets and they can easily be bought at the nearest pet store.

                  The price does not include VAT, customs duties, and import fees from your country. Depending on where you live, backers are responsible for paying these fees themselves.

                  For about 30 days after the conclusion of the crowdfunding campaign, DOCLawn will still be available to order on our website doclawn.com. Only after sending DOCLawn to our backers and fulfilling all orders received from the site we will start selling DOCLawn elsewhere.
